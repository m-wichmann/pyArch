# TODOs and ideas
* Maybe add module and memsegment class as base classes for modules (cpu, mem) and memsegments (ram, rom, mio)
    * also change dir structure
* add util class for e.g. hex print
* maybe make system a template for a system. Basically a system could represent a specific memory layout. 
* cpu should start a new thread so first thread can control sleep state and so on for the cpu
