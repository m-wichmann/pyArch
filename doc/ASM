# ASM
This document describes the assembly language for pyArch.

* Base ASM (only instructions supported by the "hardware")
    * mnemonic(flags) op1, op2
    * every part except mnemonic is optional (at least for some instructions)
    * either make flags a bitvector or use menmonics
    * one line, one instruction
    * add(0x12) r1, r2
    * Alles ab ";" gilt als Kommentar

* Extended ASM (more convienient style)
    * basically the same as base asm but with following extensions
    * labels are signaled by ":" at the end of the line and referenced by @
